# probabilistic-modelling

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks containing both the theory and implementation of several probabilistic machine learning models. It mainly consists of basic models that I had previously implemented.

1. [Bayesian linear regression](notebooks/bayesian-linear-regression.ipynb)
2. [Gaussian process regression](notebooks/gaussian-process-regression.ipynb)
3. [Linear representation learning](notebooks/linear-representation-learning.ipynb)
4. [Non-parametric representation learning](notebooks/non-parametric-representation-learning.ipynb)
